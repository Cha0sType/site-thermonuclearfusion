       A div will normally have a certain margin on all sides, 
       which we obviously don't want. Therefore we set the margin
       on every side to -1% (in % to be sure it's out of screen).
       That causes the problem, that probably every element in the div will
       be at least partially out of screen, so to compensate for that, we set
       a 1% padding, whereby the element movement will be 0% again.
